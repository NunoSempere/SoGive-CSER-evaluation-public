I asked Vasco Grillo to model the risk of catastrophic risk. You can find the output in this folder. He finds that both catastrophic and existential risks are extremely unlikely, on the order of 10e-6 basis points of existential risk per century.

Previously, Toby Ord's *The Precipice* estimated existential risk from a volcanic eruption, per century, as [around 1 in 10,000](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z5KZ2cui8WDjyF6gJ/some-thoughts-on-toby-ord-s-existential-risk-estimates).

Although one could mitigate some of that risk (e.g., as argued by Mani here: <https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02177-x>; unpaywalled link here: <https://archive.is/89WNl)>), the proposed methods seem capital intensive, and extremely unlikely to meet a threshold of a basis point of existential risk for ~1 to 10 million.
