## Top down model

- If risk comes from AGI
  - AGI by location. Modelling AGI as a discrete event for convenience.
    - Chance that AGI occurs in the UK
      - Risk if there
    - Chance that AGI occurs in the US
      - Risk if there
    - Chance that AGI occurs in the EU
      - Risk if there
    - Chance that AGI occurs in China
      - Risk if there
  - Policy impact
    - Chance of policy impact in the UK
    - If policy impact in the UK, chance that it spreads to:
      - US
      - EU
      - China
    - Size of policy impact: amount of reduction in xrisk due to cummulative efforts
- If risk comes from somewhere else
  - Chance of identifying that somewhere else
    - Chance of convincing the EA community to shift their efforts there
    - Chance of policy impact

## Bottom up model

- policy interactions per year
- value of each policy interaction
- previous model
