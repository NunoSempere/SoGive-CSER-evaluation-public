abstract: "I present positive and negative aspects of CSER, and then present a synthesis of CSER as an opportunity for impact. I model its impact and apply a threshold model. I discuss modelling choices and caveats, and conclude with two recommendations: seek to reduce funging within CSER, and then make a restricted donation."
