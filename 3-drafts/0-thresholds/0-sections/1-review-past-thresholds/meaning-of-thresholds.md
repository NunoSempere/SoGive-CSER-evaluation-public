As a comment on <https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bmrr8DFufz5Yh8yRC/thresholds-1-what-does-good-look-like-for-longtermism> sent to Spencer.

There are various ways you can put a dollar value to existential risk prevention:

1. by giving a dollar value to DALYs saved. The question you are answering is: how much value (in DALYs, or in "dollars") would saving the world save? The answer looks like: amount of people who would live * dollar value of life / xrisk averted. The "dollar value of life" here will be something pretty high, like, say, 50K, 100K per year, or even higher, because a lives are valuable, something we cherish: if I were *forced* to choose between 100K and an additional year of my life, and if I didn't have any cheaper options, I don't know which one I'd go with.
2. through comparison with neartermist thresholds. The question you are answering is: if my willingness to pay is the same as for neartermist interventions, how much should I be willing to pay for existential risk interventions? The answer here looks like: amount of people who would live * about 5K / xrisk averted. Here, the value of a life represents the cheapest you can save a counterfactual life. This question might help you prioritize between longtermist and neartermist interventions.
3. through thinking about what your willingness to pay should be. The question here is: if I deploy my dollars as far as they can go to reduce xrisk, what is the cost effectiveness? The answer looks like dollars spent at the best interventions your (marginal) dollars can buy / xrisk averted. Here, what matters is how cheap you can buy the cheapest basis point of xrisk prevention.

I mention this because the decision-relevant quality is #3.
