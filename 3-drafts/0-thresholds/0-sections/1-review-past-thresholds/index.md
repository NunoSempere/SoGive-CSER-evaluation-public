Review of past thresholds
=========================

## [EA Forum question from November 2021](<https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cKPkimztzKoCkZ75r/how-many-ea-2021-usds-would-you-trade-off-against-a-0-01>)

Linch answer: ~$100M to ~$1B per basis point, based on gut feeling on the pool of grants.

Khorton's answer, based on short-termist thresholds: $3.5B, based on the value of saving lives of current living people

My own answer from back then, also based on shortermist thresholds: Upwards of $70B.

## Thomas Kwa's personal estimate

Thomas Kwa has a (private[^private]) Google doc outlining his estimates of everything in EA. To derive those prices, he backtracks from Linch's estimate. The doc is worth keeping in mind for the comment section. In it, Linch mentions that he spent a few hours to a week on his earlier estimate: so not that much time.

[^private]: I asked him if I could reference it, and he gave me his permission. But not to link.

## Open Philanthropy bar 

Per [this interview with Ajeya Cotra](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/ajeya-cotra-worldview-diversification/#last-dollar-project-022528) of Open Philanthropy, at some point they estimated a value of $200 trillion per world saved, or $20B per basis point. 

As an editorial note, note that it seems that this $200 trillion estimate is in the context of setting a threshold which would beat more well-treaded global development philanthropy, not in the context of what threshold one should set given a limited budget to reduce x-risks. That is, one could imagine thinking that spending $20B to reduce existential risk by one basis point would beat spending $20B on global health development, while still thinking that one can do much better than averting one basis point of existential risk for $20B.

## Other possible sources of thresholds

- LTFF decision criteria. The items in [What Does a Marginal Grant at LTFF Look Like?](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7RrjXQhGgAJiDLWYR/what-does-a-marginal-grant-at-ltff-look-like-funding) give some sense on how (AI-focused) marginal grants look like. From there, one could try to estimate the threshold in some midway units of impact, like impact-adjusted research years, or the threshold in existential risk averted per dollar.
- The Survival and Flourishing Fund has a very particular funding methology, where they estimate the slope of marginal funding given to their grants. However, they don't publicly publish results.
