Thresholding and estimation for medium-sized donors
===================================================

I feel that the context in which setting a threshold is different enough from the context of small donors that it's worth remarking upon. 

In the context of a large foundation like Open Philanthropy, setting a threshold serves as a mechanism for coordination between different grants officers, and as a mechanism for allocating funding between different cause areas. This coordination mechanism is needed because Open Philanthropy seeks its grantmaking to be *scalable*; it is planning to spend a huge amount of money, and building up a small bureaucratic arm to enable that.

In contrast, a small donor considering just one or a small number of donations doesn't need that technology. Instead, I think that it makes more sense to instead have "elimination tournament"-style process. Keep in your mind your current best allocation, and as you explore and learn about different opportunities, modify your best guess as to what the best allocation looks like.

Perhaps an analogy with engineering might make this make more sense. Large companies like Google or Amazon go to great lengths to make their engineering scalable and robust. They design their systems to be able to concurrently run in different servers, and pay the cost of coordination. They even go to the length of designing new programming languages, like Go. For the tradeoffs that they face and their large scale, those moves make sense. In contrast, the hobbyist programmer faces different tradeoffs. Using an unsafe language and a non-scalable architecture often makes sense, because it allows for exploration and speed.

Still, I still see need for estimation infrastructure. I feel that estimation has been underinvested in, and that we haven't gotten good enough at estimating the value of speculative, longtermist or x-risk interventions. Particularly as the years go by, I feel that has been a strategic mistake. And I have hopes for this project, partly because medium-sized donors will copy each other and adopt their best ideas, so if I produce some good estimation, it will hopefully influence more than one medium-sized donor for one year. Still, I think that thinking in thresholds is an imperfect lens.
